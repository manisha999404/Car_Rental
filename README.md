# Jack's Car Rental - Policy Iteration

This project implements the **Jack's Car Rental problem** from *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction* (Sutton & Barto). It uses **policy iteration** to solve the problem, both in the **original** and **modified** versions. The solution is optimized with **Numba JIT compilation** and visualized using heatmaps.
